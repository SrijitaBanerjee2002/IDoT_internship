# 🚧 Illinois Department of Transportation (IDoT) Visualizations Project

This project was created as part of my internship with the **Illinois Department of Transportation (IDoT)**. It uses object detection, dataset annotation, and Python-based visualizations to extract meaningful insights from real road footage.

## 📊 Project Scope

- Vehicle type tagging (e.g., ambulance, squad car)
- Road condition context (Highway vs Non-Highway)
- Weather/environment detection (Raindrops on lenses)
- Annotated image previews using COCO-style bounding boxes
- Clean visualizations via Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🖼️ Sample Visualizations

- ✅ Highway vs. Non-Highway: Donut charts, bar plots
- ✅ Emergency vs. Non-Emergency Vehicles
- ✅ Rain condition tagging frequency
- ✅ Annotated vehicle previews from camera footage

## 📂 Files in This Repo

- `IDoT_Visualizations.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook for data visualization
- `IDOT Presentation.pdf`: Project summary for reviewers
- `accident images/`: Supporting visuals from dataset

# 😊 About Me
Hi! I’m Srijita Banerjee, a recent Computer Science graduate from UIC. I love using code to solve real-world problems — especially ones that make life a little easier, safer, or more human.

I’ve worked on projects in data visualization, object detection, and backend development. I’ve also taught coding to underrepresented girls in India, interned at the Illinois Department of Transportation, and TA’d a course on ethics in tech.
