# 🚧 Illinois Department of Transportation (IDoT) Visualizations Project

This project was created as part of my internship with the **Illinois Department of Transportation (IDoT)**. It uses object detection, dataset annotation, and Python-based visualizations to extract meaningful insights from real road footage.

## 📊 Project Scope

- Vehicle type tagging (e.g., ambulance, squad car)
- Road condition context (Highway vs Non-Highway)
- Weather/environment detection (Raindrops on lenses)
- Annotated image previews using COCO-style bounding boxes
- Clean visualizations via Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🖼️ Sample Visualizations

- ✅ Highway vs. Non-Highway: Donut charts, bar plots
- ✅ Emergency vs. Non-Emergency Vehicles
- ✅ Rain condition tagging frequency
- ✅ Annotated vehicle previews from camera footage
